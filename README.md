# Routing[MVC and Web API]

This project is used to demonstrate my proficiency with Routing in Asp.Net core.

I covered techniques such as Map, MapGet, MapPost

I briefly made use of the GetEndpoint method

I included Route Parameters and and it's topics such as Default Parameters and Optional Parameters 

I implemented techniques that can be applied when working route parameters such as Route constraint. I also extended this part by demonstrating my proficiency in route constraining by implementing a custom route constraint class which is added to the Asp.net app's builder as a service
